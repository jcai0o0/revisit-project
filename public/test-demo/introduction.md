Let's get started!

### Understanding Different Visualization:
- Pie Chart: Common for showing proportions within a whole, pie charts are intuitive for some comparisons but can be challenging for precise quantitative comparisons.
- Stacked Bar Chart: This visualization is effective for showing part-to-whole relationships and trends over time or across categories, potentially offering clearer quantitative assessment than pie charts.
- Treemap: Treemaps are useful for displaying hierarchical data and proportions within a whole, offering a different spatial representation than pie charts.
- Donut Chart: Similar to a pie chart, but with a blank center, a donut chart is used to display proportions or percentages of a whole.

### Hypotheses:
- Users may find pie charts most intuitive for understanding general proportions but struggle with precise comparisons.
- Stacked bar charts may facilitate better quantitative analysis and comparison across categories than pie charts.
- Treemaps, while effective for displaying large datasets, may require more cognitive effort to interpret than pie or stacked bar charts.
- Donut charts with multiple concentric rings or hierarchical data may require more cognitive effort to interpret compared to simple pie charts or stacked bar charts.

Let's explore these visualizations together and see how they impact our understanding!
